# soil_data_prep
R Shiny code for soil site bulk data preparation web app

This code drives a web-based tool for checking and visualising soil site data running on a shinyapps.io web app at: https://soilsites-sa.shinyapps.io/data-prep/

Project-level soil site data (field descriptions and lab test data) are uploaded via an Excel template.

After final checks the data are automatically transformed and made available via a download .zip file containing CSV tables in database-ready format.
